# Homeautomation



This is a arduino uno code for home automation system where when each person enters the room the intensity of light increases (this is upto 5 persons) using ldr and pir sensors . Where D2 in arduino uno is connected to signal pin in pir sensors and D8 in arduino uno is connected to terminal 8 in relay SPDT .Terminal 12 in relay SPDT is connected to positive power supply and negative power supply is connected to Terminal 2 bulb.Terminal 6 in relay SPDT is connected to teriminal 1 of bulb Where A0 in arduino uno is connected to LDR Pin in terminal 2.And connect Air conditioner to whichever pin and terminal you like when sixth person enters make air conditoner ON.

THIS IS FURTHER MADE INTO A IOT PROJECT USING BLYNK APP.
